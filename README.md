# Imposter_master
a set of hacks for Among us made by a begginer reverse engineer using python and the pymem module.

If you just want to try them out without bothering about how it works then download the.rar and go into dist/among2.0 and find then exe, run it when in a game.

Please look at my source code 

some of the functionality only works with keyboard and mouse in-game because it uses the keybinds for the game.
auto kill works by spamming 'q' so remember to deactivate it before trying to type anything 


list of hacks include:

force imposter, 
 no kill cooldown, 
 kill distance is always max,
 speed hacks,
 can become ghost and come back alive (even if killed or ejected),
 maxed vision,
 auto kill.
 
 please note auto kill will only work if you're using keyboard and mouse

Updates will be made promptly until I feel this is complete

for those of you who have an understanding of game RE or if you know how memory works, this hack relies on up to date offsets so if this doesn't work all of a sudden that is most likley why, also if you look at my code and see some stupid things please let me know (there are alot).
